EduFlow AI – AI Improvement Requirements (for Claude)
Purpose of This Document

This document defines how AI is used to improve EduFlow AI, what AI must do, what AI must not do, and how AI integrates with the existing Django-based system.

AI is an augmentation layer, not the core executor.

1. Design Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

AI in EduFlow AI follows this rule:

AI plans and advises.
Deterministic logic executes and enforces.
The user always retains control.

AI output must be:

Explainable

Structured

Optional (user can edit or ignore)

2. AI Scope Overview

AI is used in three controlled scenarios only:

Event → Learning Plan Decomposition

Task-Level Time & Focus Suggestions

Adaptive Re-Planning (Triggered, Not Continuous)

AI is never used for:

Real-time timer control

Calendar conflict resolution

Enforcing breaks

Automatically modifying schedules without user approval

3. AI Use Case #1: Event → Learning Plan Generation
Trigger

When a user creates or updates an academic event

Or when user explicitly clicks “Generate AI Plan”

Input to AI

Structured input only:

Event title

Event type

Event date

Total preparation time (hours)

User-written description

User preferences (focus mode, daily limit)

AI Responsibility

AI must:

Understand the learning goal

Decompose the goal into atomic learning tasks

Estimate reasonable learning duration per task

Classify task difficulty and cognitive load

AI must NOT:

Assign calendar dates

Decide number of sessions per day

Override user limits

Required AI Output (STRICT SCHEMA)

AI output must be valid JSON and match this structure:

{
  "goal_summary": "string",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "task_type": "concept_review | practice | deep_practice | revision | mock_test",
      "suggested_duration_minutes": 25,
      "difficulty": "low | medium | high",
      "cognitive_load": "low | medium | high",
      "notes": "optional string"
    }
  ]
}


Constraints:

No task longer than 60 minutes

Prefer 25–45 minute tasks

Tasks must be independent and reorderable

4. AI Use Case #2: Task ↔ Time Tracker Integration
Concept

Every AI-generated task must be directly actionable and linked to a timer.

Behavior

When a user opens a task:

System shows:

Task objective

AI-suggested duration

Suggested focus mode (Pomodoro / Extended / Deep Work)

User clicks Start

Timer starts with:

Pre-filled suggested duration

Manual stop allowed

Data Captured

Suggested duration vs actual duration

Completion status

Overrun or underrun delta

AI does NOT:

Start or stop timers

Force breaks

Block user actions

5. AI Use Case #3: Adaptive Re-Planning (Improvement Loop)
Trigger Conditions (Rule-Based)

AI is invoked only if:

User repeatedly exceeds suggested durations

User skips multiple tasks

Event is flagged “at risk”

AI Responsibility

AI may suggest:

Splitting tasks into smaller units

Reducing task difficulty per session

Increasing revision frequency

Adjusting recommended focus mode

Output

AI returns suggestions only, never automatic changes.

Example:

{
  "issue_detected": "tasks_overrunning",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "action": "split_task",
      "task_title": "Solve word problems",
      "new_duration_minutes": 30
    }
  ]
}


User must explicitly approve changes.

6. AI Architecture Requirements (Django)
Separation of Concerns (MANDATORY)

AI logic must live in a dedicated module:

ai/
 ├── prompts/
 │   ├── plan_generation.txt
 │   ├── replanning.txt
 ├── schemas.py        # JSON validation
 ├── services.py       # AI calls + safety checks


AI calls must NOT be placed in:

models.py

views.py

signals.py

7. Safety, Stability, and Cost Control

AI calls must be:

Event-based, not continuous

Cached per event unless user regenerates

Logged with input/output for debugging

If AI fails:

System falls back to deterministic scheduling

User sees a clear, non-blocking message

8. Metrics for AI Effectiveness

The system must be able to measure:

Task completion rate (AI vs non-AI)

Average time overrun per task

Event deadline success rate

Reduction in overlong focus sessions

AI features should be adjustable based on these metrics.

9. Success Criteria

This AI improvement is successful if:

Users understand what to study each day

Tasks feel achievable, not overwhelming

Timers align with real cognitive limits

Fewer last-minute study spikes occur

10. Final Instruction to Claude

When implementing AI features:

Prefer structured outputs over creativity

Prefer predictability over “smartness”

Always preserve user agency

Never break deterministic core logic
