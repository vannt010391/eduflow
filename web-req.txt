EduFlow AI – Web Application Requirements

Technology Stack: Django (Backend), SQLite (Database), HTML/CSS/JS (Frontend)
Target Users: Students (primary), Teachers/Admin (future extension)
Platform: Web Application (Desktop-first, responsive)

1. Product Overview

EduFlow AI is a smart educational planning web application designed to help students manage academic events and optimize their focus–break rhythm to improve learning effectiveness and reduce mental overload.
Unlike traditional calendar or reminder tools, EduFlow AI transforms each academic event (exam, deadline, presentation, extracurricular activity) into a structured preparation plan with distributed study sessions and intelligent break recommendations.

Core Value Proposition:
“Not only managing time, but managing learning energy.”

2. Core Functional Pillars
2.1 Event Edu Planner (Academic Event Management)
Purpose:
Help users plan, prepare, and complete academic events without last-minute cramming.

2.1.1 Event Management
Users can create, edit, delete academic events:
Exam
Quiz/Test
Assignment deadline
Presentation
Extracurricular activity

Required event fields:
Event title
Event type
Event date & time
Subject / category
Priority level (low / medium / high)
Estimated total preparation time (hours)
Description (optional)

2.1.2 Automatic Preparation Schedule Generation
When an event is created, the system automatically:
Calculates remaining days until the event
Splits total preparation time into multiple study sessions
Distributes sessions evenly across available days
Each generated study session includes:
Date
Start time (default or user-defined)
Duration (e.g., 25–50 minutes)
Suggested content/task (user editable)

2.1.3 Progress Tracking & Deadline Risk Warning
Users can mark study sessions as:
Completed
Skipped
Postponed

System tracks:
Percentage of completion per event
Remaining workload

Visual warnings when:
Too many sessions are incomplete
Event date is approaching with low completion rate

2.2 FocusBreak AI (Focus & Rest Optimization)

Purpose:
Optimize learning efficiency by managing focus duration and rest timing.

2.2.1 Study Session Tracking
Each study session records:
Actual start time
Actual end time
Effective focus duration
anual start/stop timer for study sessions

2.2.2 Intelligent Break Recommendation
Default focus models:
Pomodoro (25/5)
Extended focus (45/10)
Deep work (60/15)

System suggests:
When to take a break
Recommended break length
Break suggestions adapt based on:
Consecutive sessions
Total daily study time

2.2.3 Overload Prevention

Alerts when:
A single session exceeds safe focus duration
Total daily focus time exceeds threshold
Encourages sustainable study habits

3. Analytics & Effectiveness Measurement

The system must provide measurable learning outcomes.

3.1 User Metrics Dashboard

Display:
Daily average focused study time
Total study time per week
Number of completed study sessions
Event completion rate

3.2 Effectiveness Indicators

Percentage of events completed on time
Reduction in overlong study sessions
Consistency of daily study habits

4. User Roles (Initial Phase)
4.1 Student (Primary Role)

Full access to:
Event creation and planning
FocusBreak tracking
Analytics dashboard

(Teacher/Admin roles are out of scope for initial version but database design should allow future extension.)

5. System Architecture Requirements
5.1 Backend (Django)

Django REST-style architecture (even if frontend is server-rendered)

Core apps:
users
events
study_sessions
focus_break
analytics

Authentication:

Django built-in auth (username/email + password)

5.2 Database (SQLite)

Use SQLite for MVP simplicity

Core models:

User
Event
StudySession
FocusSession
BreakSession
Relationships:

One User → Many Events

One Event → Many StudySessions

5.3 Frontend

Server-rendered Django templates OR lightweight JS (no SPA required)

Key pages:

Dashboard

Event list & event detail
Study session timer
Analytics overview

6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Usability

Minimal cognitive load
Clear daily action list (“What should I study today?”)
Mobile-responsive layout

6.2 Performance

Must support at least:

1,000 users

10,000 events

100,000 study sessions

6.3 Data Integrity

Automatic recalculation when:
Event date changes
Preparation time changes
Prevent data loss on session interruption

7. MVP Scope (Phase 1)

Included:
User authentication
Event creation & auto scheduling
Study session timer
Break recommendations (rule-based)
Basic analytics dashboard

Excluded:
AI personalization (ML-based)
Teacher/admin dashboards
Mobile app
External calendar integration

8. Future Expansion (Not for MVP)
AI-based adaptive focus modeling
Teacher dashboards
LMS integration
Mobile application
Cloud database (PostgreSQL)

9. Success Criteria
EduFlow AI is considered successful if:
Users can clearly see daily study tasks
Events are completed on time more frequently
Average focus session length becomes more balanced
Users report reduced last-minute studying behavior
